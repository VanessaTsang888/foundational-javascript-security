# Foundational Javascript Security

https://www.linkedin.com/learning/foundational-javascript-security/

**_Why?_**

It is software development best practice for software developers to stay on top of secure coding (also known as defensive coding) as much as possible because a lot of cyber security vulnerabilities are due to lack of security built in to software applications. This is why I am taking this Foundational Javascript Security training course on LinkedIn Learning training platform.

Whilst I am taking this course, I am thinking about my projects at my full time job and how I can use the skills from this course in those live projects. After this course, I can make a plan in how exactly I can use my new learnt skills within my role as Software Engineer since my focous is software development (JavaScript development).

## Resources

The main resource for this training course it the [OWASP Top - The Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/) website.
This courses teaches the most important security threats for software developers that we can read about on the [Top 10 Web Application Security Risks page](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

Other resources include [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) and [AppSensor](http://www.appsensor.org/).

## Content

There are four main sections to this training course and they are:

1. Introduction and Setup
2. Reconnaissance
3. top Security Threats
4. Security Threats Applied

### My Comments

To demonstrate my understanding of the course material, I will use code comments to write my notes and comments. However, for additional notes and comments, I will create my own markdown files and use the markdown syntax to actually write my notes.

I am hoping to find a software engineer / developer to do my code review or just to check my notes taken from this course as I feel taking onboard comments and feedback from other software developers demonstrates positive collaboration and this helps me grow as a sound software developer.
