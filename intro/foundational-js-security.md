In mid 2019 I have had cyber security training within software engineering and some parts of this training course will be a refresher and the rest will be an update as I know how quickily technology develops. Therefore, yes I do sometime wonder how secure is the software and website I am working on in my day job? My experience in hacking and security measures maybe a little outdated and I feel this training course will help with this.

## Reconnaissance and Security Tools

This course will provide me with a foundation in reconnaissance and security tools.
Will give me the basic skills to assess common security threats.
Learn how to anticipate thrreats (SAST) and improve your security awareness (source code analysis) in order to reduce how vulnerable my JavaScript code might be.

## My Goal

My goal of taking this training course is to learn most effient way to increase the security of my JavaScript website and software applications in my day job as software engineer.
