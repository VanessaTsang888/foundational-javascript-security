# Plan an attack strategy

The Plan:

An ethical hacker always needs a plan, which they would normally presents to their client. 
The plan of atack conists in properly determining what are going to be the steps to evaluate the resources are vulnerable or not.
When a white hat hacker is hired to evaluate specific resources, the plan needs to be customised to fit this approach. Example, we are hired to evaluate an applications vulnerabilities. This what the plan would look like:

1. Reconnaissance:
Evaluate vulnerailities of the application's code database access to users.

2. Weapon or tool:
Create the script tool for exploiting the resources. 

3. Exploit delivery:
send the exploit or upload to the application database. 

4. Automatic installation: 
install the tool or code in the application. At this stage we can make small changes to the code so the hacker could demonstrate the success of the exploit and how dangerous it could be. 

5. Control of resources:
Report to the client what recommendations, or code or system changes need to be done in order to improve the appliation security.

6. Communication of remedy:
So as we determin how we can evaluate our application's vulnerabilities, have a plan of attack in place and commuicate it to all atakeholders.
