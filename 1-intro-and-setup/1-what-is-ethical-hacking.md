**_Unethical Hacking_**:

This is the Black Hat hackers up to no good such as cyber attacks. They will use all kinds of techniques to access privileged data, destroy the same data, all for their own benefit.

**_Ethical Hacking_**:

This is the White Hat hackers and it is the opposite of unethical hacking. They use same technique (methods and tools) but only to deterine if the resources are vulnerable to threats or not (vulnerabilities in the code or network), and customers pay for these services so they can understand if they are in danger of being attacked. Typically an ethical hacker will get hired by the employer to do some reconnaissance to determine if there are any **_open doors_** for hem to exploit. Then exploit these doors to figure out what data or resources they could damage or pull. Then they report their findings to the employer along with recommendations how to eliminate this system weakness.
