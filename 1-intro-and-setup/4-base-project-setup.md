# Base Project Setup

A sample project:
Resources dir has all the file I need to follow along with the instructor.

A project to look at the code and evaluate certain areas as we go through the course. Will use certain parts of the code to demo purposes.

Build a News Aggregator:
Navigate to: Resources, install the node modules and run the web app with this cmmand: `npm start`
Then in the UI we can see the base web app on: localhost:3000
